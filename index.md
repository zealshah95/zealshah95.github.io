## About Me

My research lies at the intersection of data science and development with a focus on measuring energy infrastructure systems in developing and developed regions. Particularly, my work focuses on developing techniques for measuring and mapping the quality and reliability of electricity systems using remote sensing data and machine learning. 

During my tenure as a PhD student, I have worked on a variety of practical data engineering and data science projects as an intern at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) and [Atlas AI](https://www.atlasai.co/).

Prior to joining UMass, I interned at [SparkMeter](https://www.sparkmeter.io/) where I worked on smart meter data analytics. I completed my MS in [Energy Science, Technology & Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), Pittsburgh, and my BS in Electrical Engineering from [PDEU](https://www.pdpu.ac.in/), India. 

**I am on the industry job market for summer/fall 2023!**
